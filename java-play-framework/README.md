# Rookout and play-java-starter-example

This is a starter application that shows how Play works with Rookout.

Before following this guide we recommend completing the basic [Java + Rookout tutorial](https://github.com/Rookout/tutorial-java).

## Running with Rookout

1. Export Organization Token:
    ``` bash
    $ export ROOKOUT_TOKEN=<your-token>
    ```

2.  Run the following command:
    ``` bash
    $ make build prod
    ```

## Rookout Integration explained
This example makes sure to set up Rookout`s SDK as Java Agent for Play Framework
  1. Add Java Agent plugin
    ```
    addSbtPlugin("com.lightbend.sbt" % "sbt-javaagent" % "0.1.4")
    ```
  1. Enable the Rookout Java Agent
    ```
    lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(PlayJava, JavaAgent)
    ```
  1. Add the Rookout Java Agent to your configuration
    ```
    javaAgents += "com.rookout" % "rook" % "0.1.47" % "dist"
    ```
## Debug Playframework
