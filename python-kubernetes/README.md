# Quickstart for debugging Kubernetes deployments

These are full examples for deploying an application with Rookout using Kubernetes.

You can choose to use Rookout as a service by simply adding our SDK to your application and setting ROOKOUT_TOKEN.  
Or install the Rookout ETL Controller on your kubernetes cluster. For more information about self-hosted ETL Controller check out [our documentation](https://docs.rookout.com/docs/agent-setup.html)
