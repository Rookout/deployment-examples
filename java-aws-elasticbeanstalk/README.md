# Quickstart for debugging Java + AWS Elastic Beanstalk 

A sample application for debugging Java + AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Rookout.

Before following this guide we recommend reading the basic [Java + Rookout] guide.

This sample may be out of date. If you face any issues, please reach out to mailto:support@rookout.com and let us know.

## Adding Rookout to an existing EBS Project

To integrate Rookout into your existing java beanstalk application follow these steps:

1. Add the source files to your built .jar file.

2. Add these [.ebextensions standalone config scripts](.ebextensions) to your project configuration.
    * One sets up the Rookout ETL Agent, responsible for communicating with the Rookout service.
    * The other sets up and runs the Rookout Java Agent, allowing instrumentation and real time fetching of debug messages.

__The process is described here : [Rookout Integration Process](#rookout-integration-process)__


## Running locally
1. Compile the project jar and download the Java Agent:
     ```bash
    $ make build
    ```
2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    $ make run
    ```

3. Make sure everything worked: [http://localhost:7000/?fname=rook&lname=out](http://localhost:7000/?fname=rook&lname=out)

4. Go to [http://app.rookout.com](http://app.rookout.com) and start debugging! 


## Running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk
1. Zip the project (the files, not the parent directory), use this command in the project directory to include all hidden files:
    ```bash
    $ zip -r <DEST_FILE.zip> * .*
    ```

2. Upload the source bundle when creating a [new Beanstalk app](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home#/gettingStarted).

3. Choose 'Java' Platform.

4. Upload the zip you previously archived in the base configuration part.

5. Make sure everything worked by accessing the url provided by Elastic Beanstalk after build completed.

6. Go to [http://app.rookout.com](http://app.rookout.com) and start debugging! 


## Rookout Integration Process
We have added Rookout to the original project by:
1. Adding sources to the project jar when building:
    ```bash
    jar cvfm target/server.jar Manifest.txt -C output/ . src/*
    ```

2. Adding Rookout's Elastic Beanstalk .ebextensions to setup the Rookout SDK and the Rookout Java Agent:
    ```
    commands: 
        "01": 
            command: wget "https://get.rookout.com" -O setup.sh
        "02": 
            command: sudo /bin/bash setup.sh agent --token=<YOUR_TOKEN>
        "03": 
            command: /etc/init.d/rookout-agent start
    ```
    ```
    files:
        "/opt/elasticbeanstalk/lib/rook.jar" :
            mode: "000444"
            owner: root
            group: root
            source: "http://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.rookout&a=rook&v=LATEST"
    option_settings:
        aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
            JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: '-javaagent:/opt/elasticbeanstalk/lib/rook.jar'
    ```
