# Quickstart for debugging Python + AWS Lambda

A sample application for debugging Python apps deployed in AWS Lambda using Rookout.

Before following this guide we recommend reading the basic [Python + Rookout] guide

This sample may be out of date. If you face any issues, please reach out to mailto:support@rookout.com and let us know.

## Rookout Integration Explained

To integrate Rookout into your existing Python Lambda app, follow these steps:

1. Add the pip dependency `rook` in the project folder.

1. Wrap your lambda_handler function in our Rookout wrapper.

1. Set your Rookout Toekn as an environment variable in the Lambda configuration.

## Running on Lambda
1. Make sure your python module is called `lambda_function.py` to use our example.

1. Uploading your function : 
    - Zip Upload: In order to run your rookout wrapped function on Lambda, make sure the dependencies are downloaded and zip
    the folder (including all the modules installed by pip).  
    zip -r rookout_lambda_test.zip .

    **IMPORTANT:** _If you are building on a MacOS/Windows machine, pip will compile native binaries for this platform. AWS Lambda runs on Linux and thus needs the linux compiled binaries. The solution is doing `pip install <MODULE> -t .` on a Linux machine such as an EC2 instance and re-archive the zip for uploading to Lambda._

    - aws-cli : Create a new Lambda function and update it like so :
        ```bash
        aws lambda create-function \
                    --region <REGION> \
                    --function-name rookout_lambda_test \
                    --zip-file fileb://rookout_lambda_test.zip \
                    --role <ROLE-ARN> \
                    --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
                    --runtime python2.7 \
                    --environment Variables="{ROOKOUT_TOKEN=<org_token>,ROOKOUT_ROOK_TAGS=lambda}"```

        **If you do not have access to aws-cli, you can do this from the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home/functions) and follow the [Amazon Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/get-started-create-function.html)**

    - **OR** Using Cloud9 IDE integrated tools

1. Set your Rookout Token as an environment variables in the Lambda configuration:
    - `ROOKOUT_TOKEN` : Your Organization Token

1. Go to [app.rookout.com](https://app.rookout.com) and start debugging !

## Rookout Integration Process

We have added Rookout to the original project by:
1. Installing the Rookout SDK: `pip install rook -t .` (installs module in root folder)

1. Wrapping our function by using our Rookout lambda decorator as follows:
    ```python
    from rook.serverless import serverless_rook

    @serverless_rook
    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        return 'Hello World'
    ```
    
1. Setting our Rookout Token as a Lambda environment variable: `ROOKOUT_TOKEN`
