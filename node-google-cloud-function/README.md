# Quickstart for debugging a google cloud function + NodeJS using Rookout  

A sample application for debugging a google cloud function + NodeJS using Rookout

Before following this guide we recommend reading the basic [Node + Rookout](https://docs.rookout.com/docs/node-setup/) guide

## Rookout Integration Explained

To integrate Rookout into your google function, follow these steps:

1. Edit the package.json and add Rookout as project dependency
2. Set your Rookout Token as the ROOKOUT_TOKEN environment variable
3. Call to rook start function in the beginning of your index.js file:
``` js
const rookout = require('rookout');
rookout.start();
```
4. Go to [app.rookout.com](https://app.rookout.com/) and start debugging !

We recommend to increase the memory of the function to 1GB due to low CPU resources with lower memory allocation.
