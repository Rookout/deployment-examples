# Quickstart for Java + Gradle and Docker-compose

A sample application for using Rookout to debug a Java app built using Gradle, and deployed using Docker Compose.

Before following this guide we recommend reading the basic [Java + Rookout] guide

This sample may be out of date. If you face any issues, please reach out to mailto:support@rookout.com and let us know.

## Running local application using Agent-less
1. Clone and compile the project jar and download the Rookout Java Agent:
     ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/Rookout/deployment-examples/tree/master/java-gradle
    ```
2. Export organization token:
     ```bash
     export ROOKOUT_TOKEN=Your-Token
     ```
3. Run using gradle:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew jar run
    ```
4. Make sure everything worked: [http://localhost:7000/](http://localhost:7000/)

5. Go to [http://app.rookout.com](http://app.rookout.com) and start debugging! 

## Rookout Integration explained

This example is based of the Java javalin "Hello-World" example available [here].

We have added Rookout to the original project by:
1. Adding sources and dependencies to the project jar (`build.gradle`):
    ```properties
    // grab resources
    jar {
        from sourceSets.main.allSource
    }
    
    // declaring dependencies to Rook agent
    configurations{
        rookoutAgent
    }
    
    // Running Rook
    dependencies {
        rookoutAgent "com.rookout:rook:0.1.36"
    }
    ```
2. Specifying the Rookout Java Agent when running:
    ```bash
        java  -javaagent:rook.jar -jar build/libs/rookoutDemo-1.0.0.jar
    ```
